// The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes the height of candle .

// My Answer:
function birthdayCakeCandles(ar) {
    let newAr = [];
    let maxNum = Math.max(...ar);

    for (let i = 0; i < ar.length; i++) {
        if (maxNum === ar[i]) {
            newAr.push(ar[i])
        }
        else {
            console.log("keep checking")
        }
    }
    return newAr.length
}

let ar = [4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 1, 0, 5];
